#power analysis for BTBW Sex ratio
#do we have enough power in our sample size to detect an effect of food supplementation on sex ratio
#the probability of detecting a particular effect (of a particular strength), at a particular alpha level (usually 0.05) if this effect is present.

#alpha 0.05 <--type I error 
#power 0.8 <--type II error 
#sample size, need std dev of response variable 
#difference to detect
